# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it may not always trigger reliably or may trigger multiple times unexpectedly. The `authBug.js` file showcases the problematic behavior, while `authSolution.js` provides a potential solution to address the inconsistencies.

## Problem
The `onAuthStateChanged` listener is crucial for reacting to changes in user authentication state. However, under certain conditions (e.g., network latency, rapid state changes), it might not fire consistently. This can lead to UI updates not reflecting the actual authentication status, resulting in unexpected user behavior.

## Solution
The proposed solution implements more robust error handling and potentially debouncing mechanisms to ensure that the listener responds appropriately and does not fire multiple times in rapid succession.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run `authBug.js` to see the potentially erratic behavior.  Then, examine `authSolution.js` to understand how improved error handling and timing can lead to a more reliable listener implementation.
