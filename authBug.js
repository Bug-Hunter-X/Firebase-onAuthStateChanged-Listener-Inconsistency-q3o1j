The Firebase SDK's `onAuthStateChanged` listener might not always trigger when the authentication state changes, leading to unexpected behavior in your application. This can occur due to timing issues, network problems, or other edge cases.  For example, a user might successfully sign in, but the listener fails to update the UI accordingly.  Another potential issue is that the listener might trigger multiple times unexpectedly causing unwanted side effects.
